# Back-To-Hack-2021: Go Green

# Project Motivation
Environmental problems are always a hot topic. We want to let everyone help the environment by reducing the amount of carbon footprints in their daily travel, so we come up with the idea to create a Google app with carbon footprints.

# App functions
The app provides users alternative routes along with carbon footprints under a user defined time constraint, so they can leave the least amount of carbon footprints as well as arriving the destination efficiently.

# Technology
We use React as frontend and Express as backend. In the frontend, the user can enter the origin, destination and time limit in the search bar, and a map is pre-loaded with Google map api. When a request is formed, it will return all the alternative routes in the order of least to largest carbon footprints. We created a formula with time and carbon footprint included to list the order.

# Difficulties
we are not familiar with frontend and can't load the map well

# Success
we sorted out a /maproutes api with all the data correctly returned.

Furthermore
provide more filters and add more factors to the formula so the order of the alternative routes are more considerable.

## Fontend: /website: use npm start to start the map
